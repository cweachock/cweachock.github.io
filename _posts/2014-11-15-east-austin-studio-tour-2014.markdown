If you’re traveling to Austin in the next couple weekends you should attend the East Austin Studio Tour from November 15th-23rd and come check out my paintings! 
It’s a local citywide exhibit featuring artists near and far across the great state of Texas.  

## Texans make art better

But it's not just about the art of course. The tour is also a really great excuse to get out, explore the city, and get free booze, maybe some food too.
Not to mention, it's a fantastic advertising and marketing opportunity for businesses to showcase and promote themselves while making connections to the local art community.  

In my case, my friends at [Createscape Coworking](http://createscapework.co/){:target="_blank"} were gracious enough to let me exhibit at their space alongside a great group of Texas artists including: [Heather Ringman](http://www.ringmanpaintings.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Hallie Rae Ward](http://HallieRaeWard.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Christopher Fitzgerald](http://www.christopherfitzgerald.com){:target="_blank"}, [William Gerin](http://www.epiphone.com/…/20…/Epiphone-in-Stained-Glass.aspx){:target="_blank"}, and myself. 

I am exhibiting four works of art. Two master copies and two personal works. The master copies come from an American painter named Wayne Thiebaud,

whose work was most widely known in the 1960's and lumped together alongside other famous POP artists like Andy Warhol and Jean-michel Basquiat. 
Thiebaud's paintings are bright and colorful, usually depicting commonplace objects like pies, lipsticks, paint cans, ice cream cones, and gumball machines.
