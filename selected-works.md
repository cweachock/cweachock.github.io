Thank you for considering me. Below are some snippets taken from my portfolio show casing a 
mixture of selected works from development to design. I have provided some short descriptions 
for each, but happy to answer any questions or go into details for every item listed. 
Thank you for considering me!

## Development 
### User Testing
- *Checkout optimization*: In this AB test, we tried to simplify the shipping fields and shorten 
the form length in height to help increase click-through and conversion rates. [view css](https://gist.github.com/cweachock/632bbca6e2d48ef4a469052a5edeece7),

- *Product Tabs*: For this split test, I implemented some simple product tabs to decrease the height of the 
product details page so customers could engage with more content below the fold sooner. [Watch Video](https://chrisweachock.com/videos/product-tabs-horiztonal-test1-wide.mp4),
