**Thank you for considering me!** Below is a selection of some of my most recent work randing from development to design. I have provided some short descriptions for each, but happy to answer any questions or go into details for every item listed. Enjoy!

## Development 
### User Testing
- **Checkout optimization**: In this AB test, we tried to simplify the shipping fields and shorten 
the form length in height to help increase click-through and conversion rates. [view css](https://gist.github.com/cweachock/632bbca6e2d48ef4a469052a5edeece7),

- **Product Tabs**: For this split test, I implemented some simple product tabs to decrease the height of the product details page so customers could engage with more content below the fold sooner.

- **Product Landing Page Hover Description**: We wanted to test out a way for customers to be encouraged to click through to the product page. For this split test, I helped implement teaser product description text that was shown on hover.
