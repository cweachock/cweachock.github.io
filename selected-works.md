**Thank you for considering me!** Below is a selection of some of my most recent work randing from development to design. I have provided some short descriptions for each, but happy to answer any questions or go into details for every item listed. Enjoy!

## Development 
### User Testing
- **Checkout optimization**: In this AB test, we tried to simplify the shipping fields and shorten 
the form length in height to help increase click-through and conversion rates. [view css](https://gist.github.com/cweachock/632bbca6e2d48ef4a469052a5edeece7), 
[view js](https://gist.github.com/cweachock/ccb486953770d6498e6a9df42b2448a2), [watch the experience](https://chrisweachock.com/videos/simplified-shipping-test-part1-10-8-2018.mp4)
- **Product Tabs**: For this split test, I implemented some simple product tabs to decrease the height of the product details page so customers could engage with more content below the fold sooner. [watch the experience](https://chrisweachock.com/videos/product-tabs-horiztonal-test1-wide.mp4),
