## Development 
### User Testing
- **Checkout optimization**: In this AB test, we tried to simplify the shipping fields and shorten 
the form length in height to help increase click-through and conversion rates. To do this, we have hidden the form fields below the customer's physical address and dynamically add them back in after the physical address has been filled.

- **Product Tabs**: For this split test, I implemented some simple product tabs to decrease the height of the product details page so customers could engage with more content below the fold sooner.

- **Product Landing Page Hover Description**: We wanted to test out a way for customers to be encouraged to click through to the product page. For this split test, I helped implement teaser product description text that was shown on hover.

### Visual Design
While working at Mark Cuban Companies I was responsible for visual design, marketing deliverables and everything in between. Early on, I was involved with graphic design, new branding initiatives, ads, typography, and packaging concepts. [Here](https://chrisweachock.com/visual-design/) are a few samples from various companies that showcase the breadth of my work. 

### Animation 
In addition to visual design, I always enjoy learning about animation. I got the opportunity to do some animation for a couple kickstarters and love incorporating it into the web as well. View some samples [here](https://chrisweachock.com/animation/)
