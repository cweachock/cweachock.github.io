## A Short Glimpse Into The Past/Present 
But first, let me tell you that I’m currently doing freelance web development being my best [hipster] self in Denton Texas with a focus on [@shopify](https://www.shopify.com){:target="_blank"} and learning more about ecommerce. Sounds fun right? Previously, I worked for [@mcuban](https://twitter.com/mcuban){:target="_blank"} at [Mark Cuban Companies](http://markcubancompanies.com/){:target="_blank"} with a small team onboarding companies from the hit reality show [Shark Tank ](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank){:target="_blank"} on [ABC](http://abc.go.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

On the side, I try to grow stuff. And no not weed (at least not yet). I’ve seen some success at growing plants that you can eat and constantly learn about new organic practices and standards like [regenerative agriculture](https://www.patagonia.com/blog/2017/09/join-us-the-journey-to-regenerative-organic-certification/){:target="_blank"}, [organic gardening](https://rodaleinstitute.org/){:target="_blank"}, and [hyrdoponic farming](https://modernfarmer.com/2017/05/is-hydro-organic-farming-organic/){:target="_blank"}.

Sometimes I even save my own urine—(soooo gross I know) **BUT** you can use it as a fertilizer because it contains some pretty cool elements like phosphorous, magnesium, and nitrogen. I wonder how different American Agriculture and sewege collection would be...in addition to saving water from upcycling it. Check out this [Scientific American article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-urine-is-an-effective-fertilizer/){:target="_blank"} to see I'm not joking.

I’m also really big into community projects. I volunteered at [Promise of Peace community garden](http://promiseofpeace.us/){:target="_blank"} for 2 years outside of my day job learning about organic gardening, designed a community newsletter that was distributed to [a neighborhood](http://www.littleforesthills.com/){:target="_blank"} of 1,000 plus residents in east Dallas, volunteered at a handful of [conferences](http://circlesco.com/){:target="_blank"} and [biked across the country](https://classic.bikeandbuild.org/rider/9274){:target="_blank"} in the summer of 2017.

### Rewind to 2013
After graduating in 2012 from Texas A&M University with a BS in [Visualization Sciences](http://viz.arch.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I studied computer animation, art, and design, I was fast tracked back to my hometown — Dallas — where I took an early job at [Naked Pizza](https://nkdpizza.com/){:target="_blank"} invested in by Mark Cuban. 

### 2013 - 2014
For about 9 months, I designed, animated, and created assets for Naked Pizza, with one team in NOLA and one in Dallas. After the company got sold, I was onboarded on to work for [Mark Cuban Companies](http://markcubancompanies.com/){:target="_blank"}.

### 2014 - May 2017ish
Over the next three years, I helped onboard companies with an amazingly talented and driven team: [Peter Vogt](http://petervogt.co/){:target="_blank"}, [Michael Johnstone](https://www.michaeljohnstone.us/){:target="_blank"}, [@aminkara](https://twitter.com/aminkara){:target="_blank"}, Ken Bonzon(rest in peace), [Rachel Kuhr](https://www.rachelkuhr.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Ryan Kline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryankline){:target="_blank"}, Kayla Ketelsen, Helen McDaniel, Bethany Peters, Matthew Shields, John Simon, and many others to provide support to over dozens of entrepreneurs across a wide array of industries. 



I worked in a very fast paced environment, similar to how I imagine a start up might operate. I reported directly to Mark, sending weekly or bi-weekly progress updates while he would advise with our Business Development Manager and lead CTO in a hands on/off role. I helped execute digital marketing deliverables, branding/graphic design(logo designs, packaging etc), print work, ideating and problem solving to work through business problems and increase sales for various consumer products. 

Each process and problem for each entrepeneur or business was different. Depending on the problem, I used tools like the Adobe CC, Invision and Balsamiq for prototyping, and sublime text editor for writing simple front end code. Communication channels were normally email, Skype, or phone calls. Later, my role shifted to provide ecommerce development/design support. I built sites on [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com){:target="_blank"}, [Wordpress/Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Big Commerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/){:target="_blank"}, also learning [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/){:target="_blank"}, and HTML/CSS techniques. Much of the development work was under wraps (NDA agreements) with tight timelines if web development was needed before airing on Shark Tank. Some sites were pure bootstrapped, so tools like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/){:target="_blank"} were needed with [performance testing](https://www.webpagetest.org/){:target="_blank"}, and optimizing images using photoshop and [kraken.io](kraken.io){:target="_blank"}. 

### Summer 2017
After 3ish years of being fortunate enough to work with a notable, kind, and influential person like Mark, I decided to try a new adventure with [Bike and Build](https://bikeandbuild.org/){:target="_blank"}—a nationwide non-profit that empowers young adults to bike across the country to raise awareness and funding for affordable housing. I applied, was accepted, and rode over 3,800 miles with 35 young adults from Jacksonville Florida to Monterrey California with [#BBSUS17](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bbsus17/){:target="_blank"}. Collectively we raised over $181,350 dollars and I raised $5,136 dollars towards the cause. It was physically demanding and challenging role that took about 2.5 months or 77 days. We worked with numerous organizations like [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Veterans Village](http://www.veteransvillage.org/){:target="_blank"}, and [SBP](http://sbpusa.org/){:target="_blank"} to name a few. Most ride days averaged about 70 - 100 miles, with a few century rides (100+ miles) in a variety of terrain, and climates. I even rode through [Death Valley National park](https://www.nps.gov/deva/index.htm){:target="_blank"} and climbed 8,000+ft up to the [Grand Canyon National Park](https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm)(north rim){:target="_blank"} and [Yosemite National Park](https://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm){:target="_blank"} through Tioga pass. 

### Now
As I mentioned, now I am currently freelancing and hopefully growing to learn more about the web, growing plants for food, and painting a bit more. I’m mostly active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cweachock/){:target="_blank"}, and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-weachock-031a8263/){:target="_blank"} where you can follow me and see what I’m up to. Or you can email me at: [cweachock@gmail.com](mailto:cweachock@gmail.com){:target="_blank"} if you want to say hello or work with me! 

Cheers
-Chris
